Here’s a structured way to frame your k3s home lab project so it serves your three purposes (consolidation, re-skilling, portfolio content). I’ve grouped things into Foundational, Promotable Projects, and Cool/Nice-to-Have — with a note on how each plays into learning and portfolio value.

🧱 Foundational (baseline infra + cluster hygiene)
These are the things you’ll need no matter what workloads you run — they give you operational confidence and serve as the “plumbing.”

*   **Storage**
    *   ✅ Longhorn (already confirmed).
    *   Backups (NFS/S3 target) → mention this in your portfolio as “resilient lab cluster with backup testing.”
*   **Networking**
    *   CNI is baked into k3s.
    *   Work out DNS (CoreDNS, external-dns if you buy a domain).
    *   Plan for exposing workloads: ingress (Traefik built into k3s) vs. LoadBalancer/MetalLB.
    *   Handle PiHole design question (where do devices point their DNS?) — could be:
        *   Expose PiHole via LoadBalancer IP or NodePort on port 53.
        *   Assign a static MetalLB IP and advertise that as DNS for your home network.
*   **Cluster monitoring**
    *   K9s on your Mac for day-to-day ops.
    *   Grafana + Prometheus + node-exporter for cluster metrics.
    *   Dashboards on those three laptop screens → one each for: cluster health, workload dashboards, home infra metrics.

🚀 Promotable Projects (portfolio/career content)
These are the ones you can blog about, document in GitHub, and put on your site as “projects.”

*   **Slack Bot (done)**
    *   Already a nice story: “migrated from single Docker to Kubernetes, added persistence with Longhorn, secret management, and rescheduling across nodes.”
*   **Minecraft Answer Bot + GUI**
    *   Wrap the CLI into a pod with an HTTP frontend (Flask/FastAPI).
    *   Add a simple token limit middleware.
    *   Expose it externally with Ingress + TLS.
    *   Perfect blog/demo repo: “Serving a custom AI agent on Kubernetes with Ingress, persistence, and quotas.”
*   **Transmission + OpenVPN**
    *   Two patterns to explore:
        *   Sidecar pattern (VPN container + app container share a pod network namespace).
        *   Single pod vs. separate services (learning exercise).
    *   Career angle: “securely routing pod traffic through a sidecar VPN.”
*   **Power Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)**
    *   Scrape your plugs, store in Prometheus, visualize with Grafana.
    *   Put dashboards on the big screens.
    *   Blog angle: “IoT + observability on Kubernetes.”

🎨 Cool / Nice-to-Have (stretch, polish, fun)
*   **DNS consolidation**
    *   Run CoreDNS or PiHole as the cluster DNS for home devices.
    *   Publish DNS through MetalLB IP → all devices point there.
    *   Show in portfolio as “edge networking on k3s.”
*   **Fancy dashboards**
    *   Cluster Grafana dashboards.
    *   Display SlackBot activity metrics (scrape history JSON with Prometheus exporter).
    *   Minecraft usage dashboard.
*   **Other screen visualizations**
    *   Home automation metrics (temperature, network traffic).
    *   K8s real-time pod placement animations (eye candy, good for demos).

📚 Suggested order of attack
**Foundation:**
*   Finish Longhorn + default SC (done).
*   Install Prometheus/Grafana, node-exporter, metrics-server.
*   K9s + kubectl contexts from your Mac.
*   Decide on MetalLB for static IPs.

**Promotable Projects:**
*   Move Minecraft bot next (good external ingress/TLS story).
*   PiHole (good DNS/MetalLB lesson).
*   Transmission+VPN (good pod networking/sidecar lesson).
*   Power monitoring (adds Grafana “wow” factor).

**Cool:**
*   DNS consolidation across home devices.
*   Screen dashboards (nice to show off).

Do you want me to draft this as a polished project roadmap in Markdown (like the SlackBot setup doc), so you can drop it straight into your projects/ section or GitHub repo?
